class Huber(_Loss):
    r"""Creates a criterion that uses a squared term if the absolute
    element-wise error falls below 1 and an L1 term otherwise.
    It is less sensitive to outliers than the `MSELoss` and in some cases
    prevents exploding gradients (e.g. see "Fast R-CNN" paper by Ross Girshick).
    Also known as the Huber loss:

    .. math::
        \text{loss}(x, y) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i} z_{i}

    where :math:`z_{i}` is given by:

    .. math::
        z_{i} =
        \begin{cases}
        0.5 (x_i - y_i)^2, & \text{if } |x_i - y_i| < 1 \\
        |x_i - y_i| - 0.5, & \text{otherwise }
        \end{cases}

    `x` and `y` arbitrary shapes with a total of `n` elements each
    the sum operation still operates over all the elements, and divides by `n`.

    The division by `n` can be avoided if one sets :attr:`size_average` to ``False``

    Args:
        size_average (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default,
            the losses are averaged over each loss element in the batch. Note that for
            some losses, there multiple elements per sample. If the field :attr:`size_average`
            is set to ``False``, the losses are instead summed for each minibatch. Ignored
            when reduce is ``False``. Default: ``True``
        reduce (bool, optional): Deprecated (see :attr:`reduction`). By default, the
            losses are averaged or summed over observations for each minibatch depending
            on :attr:`size_average`. When :attr:`reduce` is ``False``, returns a loss per
            batch element instead and ignores :attr:`size_average`. Default: ``True``
        reduction (string, optional): Specifies the reduction to apply to the output:
            'none' | 'mean' | 'sum'. 'none': no reduction will be applied,
            'mean': the sum of the output will be divided by the number of
            elements in the output, 'sum': the output will be summed. Note: :attr:`size_average`
            and :attr:`reduce` are in the process of being deprecated, and in the meantime,
            specifying either of those two args will override :attr:`reduction`. Default: 'mean'

    Shape:
        - Input: :math:`(N, *)` where `*` means, any number of additional
          dimensions
        - Target: :math:`(N, *)`, same shape as the input
        - Output: scalar. If reduce is ``False``, then
          :math:`(N, *)`, same shape as the input
